        <p>Hello, my dear readers. Here is a website to help you learn and understand the content of IGCSE ICT Chapter 5 (Year 10). If you can learn something useful or feel happy on this website, I will be very happy!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, without further ado, let's look at what we need to learn today:</p><br>
        <strong>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="highlight">ICT and employment</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">ICT and working patterns</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Microprocessors in the home</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Potential health problems from ICT use</span></li>
            </ol>
        </strong>
        <br>
        <p>Today we're going to cover four chapters in total -- they won't take you long, but I'm sure you'll learn a lot by the time you've finished reading this page.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So before we really get started, I want you to read this link carefully -- it will help you understand what you need to know in this chapter, and what will be on your exam.</p>
        <ul>

                Technology 0417 Syllabus - 2020 to 2022</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>And also this one -- is a useful slide about chapter 5, it doesn't have a strong test-taking effect, but it can let you learn more knowledge, at the same time make some thinking, arouse your interest in studying the subject.</p>
        <ul>
