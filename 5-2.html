        <h2 id="ictworking">ICT and working patterns</h2>
        <br>
    <p>As you have already known, the candidates should be able to:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Describe how the use of computers has led to a number of employees changing their working patterns;</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Describe what is meant by part-time working, flexible hours, job sharing, compressed hours.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Now I'll show you a chart to answer the first question:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>The name of job</th>
                <th>How to change</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Part-time working</td>
                <td>Because of the birth of the computer, people begin to consider the possibility of part-time jobs, stock trading can also be a kind of part-time jobs, people can work at home after work using the Internet and the computer, there is no need to go to the company.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flexible hours</td>
                <td>Flexible hours is not a new concept, but the Internet and computers have helped it develop, which means workers don't need to clock in every day, they can work whenever they want and the only thing they care about is getting all the work done before the deadline. In my opinion, the advantage of doing this is that everyone's work and rest time are different, so flexible hours can ensure everyone's comfort to the greatest extent.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Job sharing</td>
                <td>Job sharing is also slowly coming into view thanks to the increasing power of the Internet and computers. Today's job sharing does not need two people face to face, they can even not in the same country or city, they just need to use the Internet and computer to complete their work in different places. At the same time, they don't have to worry about jet lag.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Compressed hours</td>
                <td>For a person to compress time is actually very comfortable, because they may be able to get three days off in each week, although they may need to complete more work in the other four days.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Now I believe that you are quite clear about question one, so we are moving on to question two. As the same as question one, I will make a chart to show your answers:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>The name of job</th>
                <th>The meaning of the job</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Part-time working</td>
                <td>It usually means working fewer days per working week and employees are normally considered to be part-time if they commonly work fewer than 30 hours per week.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flexible hours</td>
                <td>Flexible hours means you have different start and end times for your workday than the standard 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Essentially, having flexible work hours means employees can begin their work earlier in the day or later than the originally set time.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Job sharing</td>
                <td>A job share arrangement is a full-time job split between two individuals, each with responsibility for the success of the total job. Job sharing allows two staff members to share the responsibilities of one full-time position, typically with prorated salary and paid time off.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Compressed hours</td>
                <td>Staff working compressed hours work their total contracted hours over fewer working days. For example, a full-time staff member could work 36.5 hours over 4.5 days or a 9 day fortnight rather than 5 days.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
