    <br>
    <p>As you have already known, the candidates should be able to:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Describe repetitive strain injury (RSI) and what causes it;</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Identify other health issues;</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Describe some simple strategies for preventing these problems;</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Evaluate the use of IT equipment and develop strategies to minimise the health risks.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Now I'll show you a chart to answer the first question:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Definition</th>
                <th>Causes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a general term used to describe the pain felt in muscles,<br> nerves and tendons caused by repetitive movement and overuse.<br>

                <td>
                    1. using a computer mouse<br>
                    2. typing<br>

                    4. grasping tools<br>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>

    <p>Now I believe that you are quite clear about question one, so we are moving on to question two. As the same as question one, I will make a chart to show your answers:</p>
    <table class="table">

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Now I believe that you are quite clear about question two, so we are moving on to question three. As the same as question one and two, I will make a chart to show your answers:</p>
    <table class="table">

            <tr>

    <p>Now I believe that you are quite clear about question three, so we are moving on to question four. Not the same as question one, two and three, I will make two charts to show your answers:</p>
