    <h2>ICT and employment</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Are you ready to get started? Let's go!</p>
    <br>
    <p>As you have already known, the candidates should be able to:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Describe how there has been a reduction of employment in offices, as workersâ€™ jobs have been replaced by computers in a number of fields;</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Describe how there has been an increase in employment in other fields.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p id="answer1">Now I'll show you a chart to answer the first question:<br></p>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>The name of job</th>
                <th>How to reduce</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Typing pools</td>
                <td>With the development of science and technology, people no longer need such a group of people to help us type, because robots are already smart enough to do the job, they can type more efficiently and make fewer mistakes than human beings, and they don't need the time to rest.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Car production workers</td>
                <td>Their jobs are also at risk -- robots are more efficient than humans at tasks that involve repeating a task many times, at the same time, they make fewer mistakes than humans, and they can work 24 hours a day without a break.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Payroll workers</td>
                <td>Fewer people will be able to do this job, because computers can calculate much faster and more accurately than humans, and human computation requires the use of pen and paper, which is also a waste of resources. So in the end, the job will be completely replaced by artificial intelligence.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p id="answer2">Now I believe that you are quite clear about question one, so we are moving on to question two. As the same as question one, I will make a chart to show your answers:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>The name of job</th>
                <th>How to increase</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Programmer</td>
                <td>This job is becoming more and more popular because robots need people to edit their programs before they can start working, so most employers need employees to help them write out instructions quickly and well to get their robots to work.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Teacher</td>
                <td>The presence of teachers is essential because teaching requires subjective judgment, and even the most advanced AI can't teach a wide variety of students. And in the future, there will be more teachers to teach us how to use the emerging technology products.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Artist</td>
                <td>They are a group of people who will never be replaced. Of course, it is interesting to watch robot performances, but the reason why human beings invented art is to cultivate their sentiments. People will always try to learn a musical instrument or dance by themselves, because this is also the inheritance of culture. It is also because of advanced technology that people have more time to enjoy art.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <div class="box">
    <p id="text-1"><strong>Conclusion: All boring and unskilled jobs can be easily and quickly replaced by robots, while those skilled jobs, such as operating robots or carrying human emotions (such as artists), will not be easily replaced by robots.</strong></p>
